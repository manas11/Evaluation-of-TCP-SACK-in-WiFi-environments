# Introduction
â€‹Exhaustive evaluation of TCP Selective 
Acknowledgments in WiFi environments.

TCP SACK is a loss recovery algorithm and has been widely deployed in all end host
operating systems. It has an additional property of improving the TCP performance in wireless networks. 

ns-3 has an in built model for SACK. This project aims to evaluate the performanceof different TCP extensions in wireless networks, with and without SACK.

# Setup
- Network Simulator: ns-3.30.1 
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS

# Weekly Progress

## Week1: 
- Install and setup ns-3.30.1
- Understand SACK implementation in ns-3: [TCP SACK and non SACK](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/tcp.html#tcp-sack-and-non-sack)

## Week2:
- Created sample programs to change TCP extensions in ns-3.
- Understood setting up WiFi Nodes and positioning them.


## Week3:
- Created a simple topology to measure average throughput in Wifi environment.
- Added a command line argument to set sack ON or OFF.
- Topology: AP0 (having 2 STAs), AP1 (having 1 STA)
- Application used: PacketSinkHelper on APs, OnOffHelper on STAs
